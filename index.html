    <!-- Chosen Palette: Hollowshade Noir -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page, vertically scrolling application with a persistent left-hand navigation sidebar (on medium screens and up) for quick access to key sections (Overview, Beats, Adversaries). This linear structure mirrors the adventure's flow, which is ideal for a GM running a session. Beats are presented in collapsible sections to manage information density. The key interaction is a modal system for adversary stat blocks, allowing the GM to view creature details instantly without scrolling away from the current scene, which is critical for maintaining game pace. This design prioritizes at-a-glance readability and rapid information retrieval. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The primary "visualization" is the interactive At-a-Glance table which provides a high-level summary and acts as a navigation hub. Instead of traditional charts, the focus is on clear information architecture. Key mechanics like 'Countdowns' are presented in visually distinct callout boxes. Textual content, especially 'Read-aloud Text', is isolated in blockquotes for clarity. The most critical interactive element is the modal pop-up for adversary stat blocks, chosen to prevent disruptive scrolling during combat. All elements are built with HTML/CSS/JS. Confirmed NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

            <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-500">The Setting</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300">Hollowshade is a vast, swampy mangrove forest that swallowed an ancient battlefield whole. Constant rains and a diverted river turned the war-torn land into a stagnant mire dotted with tiny, isolated villages. At its heart looms Hollowshade Hill, the centerpiece of the region's dark legends. It is said that atop this hill, a coven of witches known as the "Ladies of the Forest" defeated and imprisoned a powerful druid. From this prison, a monstrous, gnarled tree sprouted, growing so vast its blood-red leaves cast the entire hill in perpetual shadow. The locals believe the witches rule this domain, keeping the worst of its evils in check. If only that were true.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="threat" class="mb-12 p-6 bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 scroll-mt-20">
            <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-500">The Threat</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300">An ancient, alien consciousness—a being of parasitic rot and arachnoid hunger—is stirring in its prison beneath Hollowshade Hill. This is the true source of the curse, the druid's prison merely the vessel it has corrupted over centuries. It now influences the swamp's fauna, driving beasts mad and breeding monstrous spiders that serve as its eyes and claws. It whispers in dreams, promising power to the desperate, like the witches who unknowingly draw their strength from its corruption. If it breaks free, its influence will spread like a plague, transforming the entire region into a writhing nest of horrors.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-300">The imprisoned entity's power is growing. Its influence seeps into the swamp, causing the wildlife to become more aggressive and monstrous spiders to wander further from the hill. The "Ladies of the Forest," sensing a shift in the balance of power, have become more active, their demands on the local populace growing crueler as their own tainted magic wavers. They treat Hollowshade as their domain, blind to the fact that they are merely caretakers for a far greater evil—one that now sees them as pests in its own nest.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-300">Forced by an urgent quest to take the fastest route, a party of five Tier 2, Level 2 heroes must traverse the cursed Hollowshade swamp. They are quickly embroiled in the locals' grim traditions, which are dedicated to the manipulative "Ladies of the Forest." A shared, prophetic nightmare reveals a greater threat: a monstrous, beating heart beneath the gnarled tree on Hollowshade Hill. Tasked by the suspicious village Ealdorman, the heroes investigate the hill, battling frenzied beasts and spider-horrors to uncover the truth. They learn they must bargain with the witches, who demand a bloody price to help them destroy the entity, forcing the heroes into a grim alliance to confront the Chittering Heart and decide the fate of Hollowshade.</p>

                        <blockquote class="read-aloud p-4 my-4">The psychic scream ceases, replaced by an unnerving silence. The chittering horrors dissolve into black dust, and for the first time since you entered this swamp, you can breathe. But as you look back towards the village, you feel a new set of eyes upon you—ancient, cold, and utterly unopposed. The swamp is quiet, but it is not free. It has merely traded one monster for another.</blockquote>
                        <p>By destroying the corrupted heart, the party has slain the ancient entity and freed the druid's spirit. The monstrous spiders across Hollowshade collapse into dust, and the oppressive psychic dread lifts from the land. The villagers are saved from the immediate arachnid threat, but in doing so, they have removed the only power that held the Ladies of the Forest in check. With their domain secure, the witches' influence solidifies. Their demands for tribute become more frequent, their punishments harsher. Hollowshade is "cleaner," but it is now a land ruled by undisputed tyrants, where fear is traded for a fragile, conditional safety. This is the lesser of two evils.</p>

The great gnarled tree rips itself from the earth, its roots like writhing tentacles. A new power, born of rot and rage, now casts its shadow over Hollowshade. The witches shriek in fury from their distant sanctum, their challenge met. The war for this cursed land has just begun, and you stand at its epicenter.</blockquote>
                        <p>By choosing not to destroy the heart, the party allows the corrupted druid's power to fully awaken. The gnarled tree on the hill shudders and rips itself from the earth, becoming a shambling, blighted titan of bark and chitin. A new, terrible power now walks the swamp. The spider infestation recedes, but in its place, a supernatural blight spreads from the hill. Plants twist into malevolent shapes, and the swamp water turns acidic. Hollowshade becomes the battleground for a war between two dark powers: the calculating cruelty of the witches versus the mindless, consuming rot of the corrupted druid. The villagers are caught in the middle, their lives now subject to the whims of two warring monsters.</p>
